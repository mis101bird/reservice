Example Project
===============

This is an example project for <a href="https://github.com/zordius/reservice">reservice</a>.

How to Start
------------

Create yelp.cfg.json file:
```json
{
  "access_token": "Go to https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication and get ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
```

Then:

```
npm install
npm start
```
Then browse http://localhost:3000/

How it works - the isomorphic app
---------------------------------

**Isomorphic Application**
* <a href="src/reduxapp.js#L11-L23">reduxapp.js</a> defines the redux store and MainComponent for both server side and client side rendering.

**Routing Rules**
* <a href="src/routing.js">routing.js</a> defines the routing rules. The `handler` function in each route describes "How to prepare data for this page?", you can see some <a href="src/routing.js#L12">service actions are dispatched</a> here.

**Routing Action**
* <a href="src/server.js">server.js</a> creates the express application. There is <a href="src/server.js#L39-L53">an express middleware</a> deal with routing, dispatch the request and routing information to redux store, execute routed handler, then rendering at server side.

**Server Side Rendering**
* <a href="src/lib/renderFullHtml.js">renderFullHtml.js</a> defined <a href="src/lib/renderFullHtml.js#L9-L18">the layout of whole Html</a>. It import the MainComponent from the <a href="src/reduxapp.js#L21-L23">reduxapp.js</a>, render it into the <a href="src/lib/renderFullHtml.js#L14">main div</a>. Here we also <a href="src/lib/renderFullHtml.js#L15">serialize the redux store state</a> into `REDUXDATA` for client side rendering.

**Client Side Rendering**
* <a href="src/reduxapp.js#L29-L31">reduxapp.js</a> is the entry point of client side script, too. It take `REDUXDATA` as initial state, create the store, then render the MainComponent into main div.

How it works - services
-----------------------

* <a href="src/actions/yelp.js">actions/yelp.js</a> is an example for creating action creators for services. Check <a href="spec/actions/yelpSpec.js">yelpSpec</a> to know the format of these service actions. These actions are pure, so you can create and dispatch these actions at both server side or client side.

* You can see service functions in <a href="src/services/yelp.js">services/yelp.js</a>. All your services will be placed and executed at server side only, so you can access secrets here safely.

* All services should be defined in <a href="src/services/index.js">services/index.js</a> as `{ serviceName: serviceFunction }` Object.

* An express middleware be setup in <a href="src/server.js#L33-L37">server.js</a>, all service requests from client side are handled here.

* A redux middleware be setup in <a href="src/middlewares/index.js#L6">middlewares/index.js</a> to handle service actions and execute the services.

* You can see an example of dispatching service action at client side in <a href="src/containers/MainComponent.js#L35-L37">MainComponent.js</a>. When user submit search, we prevent default behavior then just <a href="src/components/YelpSearch.js#L17-L20">do search at client side</a>.
